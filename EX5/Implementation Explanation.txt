first, I implemented a new system call named memsize in the xv6 operating system.
 The purpose of this system call is to retrieve the current memory usage of a process.
 Additionally, I wrote a test program, memsize_test.c, to validate the functionality of the system call.

steps:
syscall.c: Connect the system call to the system call table
syscall.h: Define a unique ID for the system call
user.h: Add a prototype for the system call in the user interface
usys.pl: Create a user-facing function for the system call
Makefile: Add the test file memsize_test.c to the build

After that, I tested the new syscall with memsize_test.c file

part 2 -bonus:
Implementing a Hello World Program:
Create a file helloworld.c with code to print the string
Add the file to the Makefile for compilation
